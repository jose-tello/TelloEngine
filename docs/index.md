# Tello engine

Tello engine is a vidiogame 3d engine, with a build in shader editor. 

This project is made as a 3rd year assigment in Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM, Terrassa, under the supervision of lecturer [Marc Garrigó](www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo/). 





Made by [Jose L. Redondo Tello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-lu%C3%ADs-redondo-tello-44918b19b/).																			![Jose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-mat-studio/HeartsOfGreed/Wiki/Welcome%20Page/Team%20Portraits/josePortrait.png) 







### Core sub-systems

##### Game Objects

·Drag and drop to reorder game objects in the hierarchy window.

·Delete game objects by pressing delete on the focused game object (while focusing the hierarchy window).

·Create default primitives, cameras (that will render to another window), and lights (now, only one light can affect the scene, this will be improved on a next release).



##### Components

·Transform: Objects can be moved / scaled / rotated 

·Mesh: 

​		-Can be picked using the mouse to select a game object.

​		-Debug display of vertex and face normals.

​		-Debug wire frame mode.



·Material:

​		-Contains the color, texture and shader.
